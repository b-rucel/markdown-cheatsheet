# Emphasis

    Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

    Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

    Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

    Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

# Code

    ```javascript
    var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(s);
    ```
     
    ```python
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
    ```
     
    ```
    No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
    But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
    ```

# Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

    | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
    | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
    | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
